        <p>Fajitas are a delicious dish that can be made any number of ways. The name of the game with fajitas is fresh ingredients. Almost any protein can be used, but for the purposes of this recipe, we will be using chicken breast and sirloin. The dish will ultimately make for a fresh-tasting, filling dish that will keep you wanting to come back for more!</p>
        <p> Fajitas can be spiced up or down depending on the chef's choice. We will make ours spicy, but with enough lime and cilantro to give us a flavor that truly pops. They can be thrown together last minute. The do require a few extra minutes of prep time, but we will make up for that with the look cooking time.</p>
