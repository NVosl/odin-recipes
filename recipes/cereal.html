    <p>Cereal is a single-guys best friend. Easy recipe with almost no preparation and no cook time. A quick dinner for the working class and delicious. It also makes for an amazing pre-bedtime ritual, whether it  is post-coital or not. It is hearty and filling, and can be whichever flavor you prefer based on your mood!</p>
    <p>There is a fine balance of which cereal to which milk, but for the purposes of this recipe, we will use whole milk as I am a dad and my kids drink whole milk. Though whole milk does not retain the cold temperature as well as skim or 1%, it does at a delectable creamyness that is exclusive to it's class.</p>
