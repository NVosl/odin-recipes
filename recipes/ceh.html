      <p>Chicken Excelsior House is an old English recipe of chicken that has been cooked in butter and garlic, and then topped with a creamy sauce with a sour cream-Cheri base that slightly hardens atop it. It procides a savory, umami flavor that perfectly accompanies pasta or can be served over rice.</p>
      <p>The dish is not difficult to make, and takes little prep time. It is an easy dish to throw together and still get fantastic and beautiful results. </p>
