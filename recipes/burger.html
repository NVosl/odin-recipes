    <h1>COPYCAT: In-n-Out Burger</h1>
    <img src="../img/burger.jpeg" alt="Two delicious-looking cheeseburgers with tomato and lettuce and melting cheest. They are wrapped in red and white paper and on a red tray with french fries and napkins. There is sauce over the french fries and the burgers look fresh and are clearly made by In-n-Out">
    <p>Of all the burgers I have had in my life, In-n-Out makes by far the most satisfying one. I have been to many botique burger joints and had innumerable gormet burgers. There is something elementally delicious about In-n-Out's. It is the perfect amount of greasy, salty, without tasting overwhelmingly like meat or dominated by a single ingredient.</p>
    <p>These burgers are suprisingly simple to make, but are pan fried, so you better have your kitchen's exhaust fan up and running. That said, they take minimal time to prepare and are delicious. This recipe is a copy-cat, but after having tried it, it nails the flavor of In-n-Out. This burger is my official go to for making burgers now. I hope you enjoy!</p>
